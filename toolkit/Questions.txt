QUESTIONS

Initial bias of 1?
Bias for EACH neuron?
Do the biases ever change? How?
Is there a WEIGHT associated with a bias? Or just the bias itself changing?

Do I update my web of weights at the end with delta weights or do I do each web as it comes?
	As I change w_delta in phases, that would affect the calculation for error and w_delta in earlier webs so the distinction is significant
